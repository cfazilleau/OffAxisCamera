# Off-Axis Camera, by Cl√©ment "CFaz" Fazilleau

# Overview

This project is a unity package for a simple and lightweight OffAxisCamera, based on [this excellent article](https://medium.com/try-creative-tech/off-axis-projection-in-unity-1572d826541e) from Michel de Brisis and the paper ["Generalized Perspective Projection"](http://160592857366.free.fr/joe/ebooks/ShareData/Generalized%20Perspective%20Projection.pdf) by Robert Kooima

### __Compatible with all render pipelines.__

# Features

This package allows for simple and fast creation of cameras with off-axis projection, to modify the camera perspective.

You only have to add this component to your camera, then set a plane size and camera position.
All those properties are accessible at runtime, and the code is commented and accessible.

The custom tool also allows to edit the projection plane size and camera POV position.
